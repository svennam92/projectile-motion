# This app is a projectile motion simulator

## Wanna deploy this app to Bluemix?

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/flowthings/projectile-motion)

## To run this locally you'll need to run these commands:

- npm install
- npm install -g gulp
- gulp
- node app

Then, navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser.

N.B.: There is a gulp step that concatinates and minifies the JavaScript and CSS. The built files are in here, but if you make changes, you'll need to run gulp. There is a watch task for gulp, but you can also just run it once and <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> out of the watch step.
